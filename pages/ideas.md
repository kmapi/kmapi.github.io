#### Make money from ads

Have a great idea for a cooking website?  Use the Kitchen Monki API to take it to the next level and reap the
rewards by serving ads from Amazon, Google Adsense, ContextWeb and more.  Make your ad system more intelligent
by showing ads for cooking utensils on recipe pages and ads for local super markets and grocery stores on
shopping list and meal planner pages.

#### Already well known?  Sell your masterpiece recipes

if you are a great chef or well known for a specific food genre, publish your recipes with us in your own private
space.  Create menus for users to browse and make your site full featured with the Kitchen Monki Tools to give
it that professionally built feeling.  Why reinvent the wheel?  We have done all the hard work for you.

--------------

#### Create a food blogging network with tools focused on their needs

Food blogging is at an all time high, but nearly all of them are just that..  Simple blogs.  Create a website
with tools for them to add their recipes, have a networking platform, and more.  Tap into the Kitchen Monki
community's database of recipes for content.  If you offer bloggers functionality not easily available to them in
say Wordpress they will link to you and drive your traffic to great heights.

#### Develop a customizable website you can resell

There is no shortage of people who love to cook, and of those people how many of them do you think would love
to have their own website?  If it were only so easy..  Developing a full featured website could cost a potential
website owner tens of thousands in development fees.  Why not make a dynamic configurable website that your can
sell and sell and sell.  Choose any platform you like and use the Kitchen Monki API to create an amazing product.

#### Make an interactive cookbook

An interactive cookbook would be fun novelty in the cooking website arena.  Especially for novice cooks looking
to get more detailed instruction than the traditional list of steps and ingredients.  With HTML5 and endless
amounts of javascript libraries and plugins available today, enticing animations and multimedia are a cinch to
integrate.  Make the experience fun!  You will make loyal followers who will fall in love with the process more
than the content.

--------------

#### Publish an online magazine

An online magazine would provide more features than a simple blog and could gain great notoriety with the right
marketing.  An online magazine focused on food would most definitely benefit from the structure that Kitchen
Monki provides.  Having your recipes in our system, would make it a snap to integrate user tools such as
bookmarking, shopping lists, and meal planning.

#### Create a weight loss site

Dieting websites are king in the recipe niche market.  It would be difficult to compete in this circle, unless
you have a secret weapon.  The vast majority of these sites are simply a list of recipes and some articles to aid
dieters.  Some of the most important factors to gaining success in weight loss have to do with the timing of
what you eat and how much you eat.  Using the Kitchen Monki API as the platform for you app, the organization
of meals is well thought out and adjusting serving sizes is calculated perfectly.

--------------

#### Make a cooking video blog

Cookbooks are great, but cooking shows are better!  Gain fans and loyal followers by putting your personality
and flamboyance on display on video.  Youtube is great, but Youtube can't integrate cooking organizational tools
onto your Youtube page.  For that, you will need your own website.  For ease of development, you could use them
to serve your videos however.  Add links to your website in the comments and watch your traffic skyrocket when
users discover the searching, planning, and shopping enhanced experience you have provided for them.

--------------

#### Hit the niche markets with mulitple sites

Generic recipe websites can be a highly competitive market to break into, unless you have a good gimmick, but
finding the right niche can make it easier to get noticed.  Want to monetize?  Make a good feature rich website
built on the back of Kitchen Monki and multiply it under many different themes (french, diet, gluten-free).
Divide and conquer.

--------------

#### Create a website from your old cookbooks

Are you a cookbook fanatic or know somebody who is?  Cookbooks have been around for centuries and the rarer the
book, the more likely it is that its not on the web which equals a good page rank for you!  Hey why not bust
out that old box of recipes on index cards you've been accumulating for the past 30 years and share them with
the world, people will thank you for it.  As with most of the other scenarios on this page, partnering up with
Kitchen Monki will easily transform your site from good to great.

--------------

#### Build an exotic foods website

Reality TV has put obscure food into the world spotlight.  Why not create an awesome website to satiate viewers'
curiosity when they search Google for something they saw on "Bizarre Foods".  If they came find your site by
searching for something out of the norm, then the chances that they will stick around will be high when they
find out your website is all about exotic meals.  So why would you need Kitchen Monki to accomplish this vision?
With the Kitchen Monki API you can add your own recipes and custom ingredients, unlike other popular recipe
APIs such as Yummly and Big Oven.  See a [comparison of features](/pages/comparison.html).
